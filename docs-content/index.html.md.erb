This documentation describes Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu. The Datadog Cluster Monitoring combines our Datadog Nozzle with the Datadog Agent, and enables VMware Tanzu users and administrators to monitor the health and performance of their VMware Tanzu clusters.

For comprehensive monitoring, you can also install the [BOSH Health Monitor](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/#configure-the-datadog-plugin-for-bosh-health-monitor).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu is made up of three components:

* The Datadog Firehose Nozzle
* The Datadog Agent
* The Datadog Cluster Agent

The Datadog Nozzle is a Cloud Foundry component which forwards metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to the Datadog monitoring platform. Any Cloud Foundry deployment can send metrics and events to Datadog. The data helps you track the health and availability of all nodes in the deployment, monitor the jobs they run, collect metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, and more.

The Datadog Agent is small daemon that is installed via BOSH addon to run on every host and collect infrastructure metrics from each host.

The Datadog Cluster Agent is a small daemon that is deployed on its own VM, and is used to resolve integration configurations with Autodiscovery and schedule them on the Datadog Agent running on every host.

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu includes the following key features:

* Visualization of all cluster level operational metrics and KPIs
* Alerting on VMware Tanzu cluster and component health
* Monitoring of jobs
* Tracking and reporting of BOSH events
* Autodiscovery of integrations

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-scale infrastructure and applications.
Datadog provides full-stack observability by combining infrastructure metrics and events with
application performance metrics and end-to-end tracing. With flexible graphs and dashboards,
sophisticated alerting, and machine learning functionality for anomaly and outlier detection,
the platform provides actionable insight into dynamic, modern environments. Datadog features
200+ vendor-supported integrations, with simple configuration and built-in template dashboards.

Additional details about the Datadog integration with Cloud Foundry are available via [Datadog's documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/).
