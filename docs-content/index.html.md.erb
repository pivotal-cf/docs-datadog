Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu combines the Datadog Nozzle with the Datadog Agent, and enables VMware Tanzu users and administrators to monitor the health and performance of their VMware Tanzu clusters.


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu is made up of three components:

* The Datadog Firehose Nozzle
* The Datadog Agent
* The Datadog Cluster Agent

The Datadog Nozzle is a Cloud Foundry component which forwards metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to the Datadog monitoring platform. Any Cloud Foundry deployment can send metrics and events to Datadog. The data helps you track the health and availability of all nodes in the deployment, monitor the jobs they run, collect metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, and more.

The Datadog Agent is software that runs on your hosts to collect infrastructure metrics, and is installed through the BOSH addon.

The Datadog Cluster Agent is software that is deployed on its own VM, and is used to resolve integration configurations with Autodiscovery and schedule them on the Datadog Agent.

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for VMware Tanzu includes the following key features:

* Visualization of all cluster-level operational metrics and KPIs
* Alerting on VMware Tanzu cluster and component health
* Monitoring of jobs
* Tracking and reporting of BOSH events
* Autodiscovery of integrations

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-scale infrastructure and applications.
Datadog provides full-stack observability by combining infrastructure metrics and events with
application performance metrics and end-to-end tracing.

Additional details about the Datadog integration with Pivotal Platform are available on the [Pivotal Platform documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/pivotal_platform/).
